    Data class for an atom.

        mass (float): Mass of the atom in kg.
        gF (float): Effective g-factor (gF), describing the magnetic moment.
        mF (float): Magnetic quantum number (mF).
        s (float): s-wave scattering length in meters. The scattering length is a measure of the effective range

        Calculate the potential energy of the atom in a magnetic field.

        Zeeman Effect: This is an approximation where the energy difference induced by
        the external magnetic field is small compared with the hyperfine splitting.
        In this case, the energy level splitting of each hyperfine state is proportional
        to the quantum number mF and the effective g-factor gF.

        Gravitational Potential Energy: The potential energy of the atom due to gravity,
        where the atom chip is oriented vertically in the upside-down configuration.

        Assumptions:
            - The magnetic field and the atom's magnetic moment are aligned.
            - The magnetic field strength is non-zero everywhere in the trapping region.
            - The atom's kinetic energy is negligible (cold atoms).
            - The atom is treated as a point particle.

        Args:
            B_mag (float): Magnitude of the magnetic field in Gauss.
            z (float): Height of the atom in millimeters.
